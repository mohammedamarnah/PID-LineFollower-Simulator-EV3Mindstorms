# PID Line Follower Simulator
(EV3 Mindstorms Robots)

This project is a simple simulator for the PID Line Following algorithm (EV3 Mindstorms version).
It was made using C++ and Processing. 
The .cpp file contains a command line tool version of the simulator, and was done first. 
The processing version is the updated one, and it contains a basic visualiser.

HOW TO USE:

- CPP: 
  You'll have to add the source file "PID" to your project, and update the files paths in the code,
  so the program outputs correctly.
  After getting your output, go to any plot grapher, copy the (x,y) points from the files and paste
  it in the website. A good plotter is: http://fooplot.com/

- Processing: 
  Just download processing for your pc, run the program and you'll see lines moving. Well, that is
  the robot moving. You can update the kp, ki, and kd factors from the code. You can change the
  colors, or make other things.
